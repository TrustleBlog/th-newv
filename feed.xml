<p><a href="https://www.mb104.com/lnk.asp?o=5358&amp;c=918277&amp;a=383461&amp;k=EF4C73D0A529A5DEAB1E15628557951C&amp;l=4125&amp;s1=trustleblog">Survey Junkie</a><a href="https://www.mb104.com/lnk.asp?o=5358&amp;c=918277&amp;a=383461&amp;k=EF4C73D0A529A5DEAB1E15628557951C&amp;l=4125&amp;s1=trustleblog">Survey Junkie</a> is a website where users to take surveys in exchange for points that can be redeemed for gift cards or a deposit into your account. Signing up for the website is quick and painless; you can use your plus account, or your email to log in.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dhj6tmg30">Is it a scam?</h2>
<p>Most in-game surveys I found were thinly veiled spam to sell a product or capture personal information. Frankly, the amount of spam has turned me off to most surveys sites or gift card offers.</p>
<p><em>Survey Junkie</em> passes on the “legitimate test,” both my wife and I used the website for over an hour, completing multiple surveys. Neither my wife nor I were directed to any shady surveys, nor were we asked to divulge any personal or sensitive information.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dhj73b8d2">Results</h2>
<p>Moreover, if you have few hours a day to complete the surveys, they could be worth three thousand to four thousand a year in retirement savings.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a way to make a few extra dollars, give <a href="https://bmv.biz/?a=1651&amp;c=1&amp;s1=" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"></a><em><a href="https://www.mb104.com/lnk.asp?o=5358&amp;c=918277&amp;a=383461&amp;k=EF4C73D0A529A5DEAB1E15628557951C&amp;l=4125&amp;s1=trustleblog">Survey Junkie</a></em> a try and let me know how it goes, should you decided to try <em>Survey Junkie, </em>please consider using my <a href="https://www.mb104.com/lnk.asp?o=5358&amp;c=918277&amp;a=383461&amp;k=EF4C73D0A529A5DEAB1E15628557951C&amp;l=4125&amp;s1=trustleblog">affiliate link here</a>.  It helps keep the site running.</p>
